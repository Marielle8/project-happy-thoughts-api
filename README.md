# Project Happy Thoughts API

This project was about how to use POST requests to send data to my own API. How to store data in my database from POST requests and how to validate data and ensure the database only contains 'good' data.

## The problem

I had some errors in my terminal when I first started this project but I could easily solved them by looking at previous solutions in slacks help channel. I did some codealong with recorded lectures from Technigo bootcamp to start the project and keep it running. I had some issues with error handling and had a hard time to grasp how to use it and when to use it. Got some help regarding that during demo time with my team. I had some other issues when I connected my backend to the frontend since I didn't get the like button to work but it turned out it was only a typo. In my search for answers about what could be wrong with the button I found some good questions on StackOverlflow that made me change some methods in my code so I think it turned out very good in the end.
